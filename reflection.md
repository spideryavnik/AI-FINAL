# Project Reflection

## Team Collaboration

- The work on this project was **evenly divided among all participants**.
- We organized ourselves into **smaller sub-teams of 2–3 people** to tackle different parts of the project.
- Each sub-team **continued from where the previous one left off**, ensuring that progress was continuous and that knowledge was shared.
- This handover-based workflow required **strong communication and coordination**, which we maintained through regular updates and clear documentation.
- The approach helped us stay synchronized and enabled a smooth transition of tasks across all areas of the project.

## Use of AI Tools

- We used **ChatGPT** as our "coding assistant" throughout the project lifecycle:
  - During backend development, ChatGPT helped us quickly scaffold Express routes, design Mongoose models, and implement validation logic with Joi. For example, when we were unsure how to structure a complex validation schema, ChatGPT provided clear code samples and explanations.
  - For API integration, we relied on ChatGPT to generate example payloads, troubleshoot HTTP status codes, and clarify how to structure Swagger documentation for our endpoints.
  - On the frontend, ChatGPT assisted in creating React components, suggesting state management patterns, and even helping us debug tricky issues with form handling and API calls.
- **Cursor** (an AI-enhanced code editor) was invaluable for rapid iteration:
  - It provided inline suggestions as we typed, helping us refactor code for clarity and efficiency.
  - Cursor's context-aware completions sped up repetitive tasks, such as writing boilerplate for controllers or updating CSS for a consistent UI.
  - When integrating backend and frontend, Cursor helped us spot mismatches in API usage and suggested fixes in real time.
- The combination of these tools **significantly accelerated our development**, especially in areas where we had little or no prior experience. They allowed us to focus on higher-level design and problem-solving, rather than getting stuck on syntax or boilerplate.

## Lessons Learned and Challenges

- We were introduced to several new technologies, including:
  - **Joi** for schema validation, which required us to rethink how we handle user input and error messages.
  - **Swagger** for API documentation, which not only improved our API clarity but also forced us to be more rigorous in our endpoint design.
  - **Mocks** for testing, which enabled us to verify our logic without relying on external services or a fully implemented LLM backend.
- One of the main challenges was **synchronizing work across multiple sub-teams**. To address this, we:
  - Used a clear git workflow with feature branches and frequent merges, minimizing conflicts and making it easy to track progress.
  - Held regular pairing sessions and check-ins, where team members could review each other's work, share context, and resolve blockers together.
- Another challenge was **working with tools and libraries we didn’t initially understand**. We often had to trust AI-generated solutions first, then consult documentation to fully grasp what was implemented. This iterative process taught us to:
  - **Balance intuition, teamwork, and AI-generated content**
  - **Validate and learn on the fly**
  - Collaborate effectively, leveraging both human and AI strengths

## General Reflections

- This project helped us **grow both as a team and as individual developers**. We learned not only new technologies, but also how to communicate, delegate, and support each other in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
- AI tools served **not as replacements for our skills**, but as **enablers** that boosted our productivity, confidence, and learning. They allowed us to move quickly from idea to implementation, and to tackle challenges that might have otherwise slowed us down.
- Ultimately, this experience showed us that the future of software development is not about humans versus AI, but about **humans and AI working together**. By combining our creativity and judgment with the speed and breadth of AI assistance, we were able to achieve more than we could have alone. This project was not just a technical achievement, but a lesson in the power of collaboration—between people, and between people and machines.
